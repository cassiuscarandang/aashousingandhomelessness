                <h2> About this Mapplication</h2>
                <p> This mapplication was created to uplift and share the lived experiences of UCLA students 
                    who have been impacted by housing insecurity or unaffordability. While past studies have gathered important 
                    findings around this issue, there is currently a lack of research that systematically collects student voices 
                    on their experience with housing and how it may impact student life. <b> Through taking the survey, this is a space 
                    where UCLA students can share their experiences, and a place where community members can learn about the impacts, 
                    barriers, and resources available to students.
