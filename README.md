# Student Housing 4 All

## The Proposal

### What social problem is being addressed?

UCLA Students are at high risk of homelessness and housing insecurity in face of high costs of housing. Although studies estimate 1 in 20 UC Students are experiencing homelessness, there is also a lack of community stories being shared in regard to the lived experiences of housing insecure students (Aziz, 2020). This project aims to address the problem's of student housing insecurity, unaffordability, and homelessness by sharing the stories of affected UCLA students. 

### Who is being empowered by your mapplication?

Our focus is to empower the voices of UCLA students experiencing housing insecurity and unaffordability. This includes UCLA students who have struggled with paying for housing-related costs, trouble finding a place to live, and those who are/have been unhoused. 

### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

Some challenges for this tool can result from reaching out to the unhoused community at UCLA. The experiences of housing insecurity and unaffordablity can be a struggle on its own, therefore sharing stories that relive these experiences can make it difficult for indivduals to open up on a web form. This will require us to build trust with this community for transparency and progress.

### Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and mention them in the write-up.

We may reach out to organizations like UCLA4All (https://twitter.com/ucla4all), a grassroots organization aimed at supporting neighbors experiecing homelessness at UCLA. We will request for their assistance with story sharing, and demonstrate how this mapplication can gain attention from stakeholders for continued support. 

## Project Details & Future Use

### Technology Used

For this project, we utilized Leaflet JS, Google Sheets, Google Forms, and a number of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Surveys were distributed using Google Form, and responses were recorded in Google Sheets. We then used PapaParse to bring in our survey data, and map the data through Leaflet JS. Mapplication was built out and designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Future Use

We hope that this tool is utilized, maintained, and updated by UCLA students and affordable housing advocates, such as UCLA For All, to continuously showcase the multi-dimensioned struggles related to obtaining affordable housing in UCLA. The long term goal is to allow students to share the difficulty in obtaining affordable housing and how it affects their overall student experience. These stories can be used as information for other students who are seeking housing at UCLA as understanding othersâ€™ experiences can help make better informed decisions. These experiences can also be shared to stakeholders, such as the UC Board of Regents, to recognize and better address the student housing issues.
