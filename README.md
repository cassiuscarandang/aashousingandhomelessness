# Housing and Homelessness

## What social problem is being addressed?

We are in desperate need for affordable housing for people that are below the poverty line and experiencing housing insecurity. We will address the issue of accessing affordable housing by showing what areas have affordable housing and what areas don't. 

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?

Low income residents are able to view the map as a possible solution to finding affordable housing, and avoiding of high cost areas. We will also help the unhoused and those experiencing housing insecurity by providing a resource towards housing. 

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

Some nonprofit organizations' data on affordable housing may not be as quantifiable, reliable, and extensive compared to other organizations, such as established housing authorities that may have more reliabile data. To create this map, we might have to draw from much more reliable and established data sources rather than solely relying on nonprofits. 

## Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and mention them in the write-up.

We will reach out to Abundant Housing LA (https://abundanthousingla.org/about-ahla/), a nonprofit focused on serving the quality of life by finding affordable housing for Los Angeles residents. We will ask them if they have geodata on affordable housing locations to provide as a resource through our map.
