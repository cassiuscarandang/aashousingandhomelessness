## Objective

This project was created with the purpose to highlight the UCLA student body’s experience of housing insecurity and unaffordability. While UCLA has conducted a study which demonstrates that 1 in 20 UC students face homelessness (Aziz, 2020), there are currently no studies that systematically collect student voices on their experience with housing and how it may impact their student life. Given the above statistic and the fact that Westwood is the most expensive place to rent in California (Flemming, 2018), we created a mapplication to showcase students’ overall experiences with housing affordability and insecurity in their own words. Specifically, we learned about the ways in which housing affordability and insecurity impacts student life; barriers experienced in obtaining affordable off-campus housing; as well as available resources they have utilized in this issue. Overall, this project is a meaningful collection of student voices that can raise awareness and empower students - particularly those experiencing housing insecurity and unaffordability. We hope that it can also become a tool for others to further address the problems of student housing insecurity, unaffordability, and homelessness.

## Who is Empowered?

Through gaining knowledge about the extent of accessibility and affrodability of housing for students at UCLA, the student community is empowered with the knowledge of others' experiences, which can further discussions and activism. The empowerment can also come from the realization that there are other students who share in the same struggles and that they are not alone.

## Technologies Used

For this project, we utilized Leaflet JS, Google Sheets, Google Forms, and a number of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Surveys were distributed using Google Form, and responses were recorded in Google Sheets. We then used PapaParse to bring in our survey data, and map the data through Leaflet JS. Mapplication was built out and designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

## Features

- Mapplication contains location markers that popup in the home page’s right panel, showcasing students experiences 
- An About tab detailing the purpose and empowerment of this mapplication
- Links to student resources provided in the About tab

## Usage

We hope that this tool is utilized, maintained, and updated by UCLA students and affordable housing advocates, such as UCLA For All, to continuously showcase the multi-dimensioned struggles related to obtaining affordable housing in UCLA. The long term goal is to allow students to share the difficulty in obtaining affordable housing and how it affects their overall student experience. These stories can be used as information for other students who are seeking housing at UCLA as understanding others’ experiences can help make better informed decisions. These experiences can also be shared to stakeholders, such as the UC Board of Regents, to recognize and better address the student housing issues.

### Who is Empowered?

Our focus is to empower the voices of UCLA students experiencing housing insecurity and unaffordability. This includes UCLA students who have struggled with paying for housing-related costs, trouble finding a place to live, and those who are/have been unhoused. 

### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

Some challenges for this tool can result from reaching out to the unhoused community at UCLA. The experiences of housing insecurity and unaffordablity can be a struggle on its own, therefore sharing stories that relive these experiences can make it difficult for indivduals to open up on a web form. This will require us to build trust with this community for transparency and progress.

### Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and mention them in the write-up.

We may reach out to organizations like UCLA4All (https://twitter.com/ucla4all), a grassroots organization aimed at supporting neighbors experiecing homelessness at UCLA. We will request for their assistance with story sharing, and demonstrate how this mapplication can gain attention from stakeholders for continued support.
